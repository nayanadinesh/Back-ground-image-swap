# Back ground image swap
 This project focuses on identifying and removing the background of an image and replacing it with a new one. Using image processing techniques like segmentation or color detection, the main subject is preserved while the background is swapped, creating a seamless and natural-looking result. It can be used for photo editing, virtual backgrounds, or fun effects.
